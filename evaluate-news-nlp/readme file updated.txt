Project: Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing

In this project I learned and use:
Html
CSS
JS
Webpack
Node.js
How to use API's
How to Test program.

Bascially for this project, first of all I have to add all the neccessary dependencies and dev dependecies in Node.js for webpack.

After this I have to set api id and api key from meaningcloud. I have add API key in .env file and then link this file in server.

This is my first time experience with Webpack.

After setting api key and alll dependencies. I make post route and asynchronize api key and url and fetch data from it.

Then create test file through which we pass the test.
